        <h2>About</h2>
        <hr>
        <p>This GitHub Chrome Extension has the goal of generating more clear and concise commit messages as suggestions to help developers better document their code refactoring changes. With several pull requests and commits in projects, it can be hard for developers or others to know exactly what is going on at a certain commit. This extension can help developers and others be more efficient by not wasting time finding the perfect documentation methodology or trying to understand the commit they made.
